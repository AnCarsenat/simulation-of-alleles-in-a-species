## Introduction
Understanding the genetic variation within a species is crucial for studying evolution and population genetics. This simulation provides insights into how alleles change frequency over generations under different evolutionary forces.

## Features
- [X] **Genetic Drift**: Random changes in allele frequencies.
- [X] **Selection**: Differential survival and reproduction.
- [ ] **Mutation**: Introduction of new alleles.
- [X] **Migration**: Movement of individuals between populations.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the simulation, use the following command:
```bash
python simulate.py --config config.yaml
```
You can customize the simulation parameters by editing the `example_one.py` file.
